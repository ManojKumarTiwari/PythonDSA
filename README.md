## DSA Roadmap

**Day TBD :**  Learn about **space and time complexity**. One of the most important part of programming is knowing the complexity of the code you writing.

##### Resources

- [Theory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-complexity-and-space-complexity/) - by Geeksforgeeks
- [Video Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV3wrLBbuuE) - By Kunal Kushwaha

##### Questions

**Day 01 :**  Learn about **Trees**. It is a nonlinear hierarchical acyclic data structure.

##### Questions

## âœ…  Progress As Per My Day :

#### ðŸ“… Day 00 :
I setup my github repo. I know basics of DSA but I still need to practise to get better with it. I will be starting with "Trees" Data Strctures and I have co-up with DSA Lectures for Masters.

#### ðŸ“… Day 01 :
I learnt the basics about Trees and most of the Geekforgeeks link above serves as notes but parts were missing there and hence I am writing them here so use this along with the [this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-tree-data-structure/?ref=lbp) for complete notes on basics of Trees

- _Depth of Node_ -> lenght of the path from root node to the node
- _Height of Node_ -> lenght of the path from node to the deepest node
-  _Level of Tree_ -> Root node is said to be at Depth 0 or Level 0 and the next layer of node is said to be at level 1 or depth 1 and so on
- _Depth of Tree_ is Depth of Root Node which is always ZERO
- _Height of Tree_ is Height of Root Node

##### Types of Binary Trees:
    - Full Tree
    - Perfect Tree
    - Complete Tree
    - Balanced Tree

##### Binary Tree Representation:
    - Using Linked List
    - Python List (or Array)
