## DSA Roadmap

**Day TBD :**  Learn about **space and time complexity**. One of the most important part of programming is knowing the complexity of the code you writing.

##### Resources

- [Theory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-complexity-and-space-complexity/) - by Geeksforgeeks
- [Video Lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mV3wrLBbuuE) - By Kunal Kushwaha

##### Questions

**Day 01 :**  Learn about **Trees**. It is a nonlinear hierarchical acyclic data structure.

##### Questions

## âœ…  Progress As Per My Day :

#### ðŸ“… Day 00 :
I setup my github repo. I know basics of DSA but I still need to practise to get better with it. I will be starting with "Trees" Data Strctures and I have co-up with DSA Lectures for Masters.

#### ðŸ“… Day 01 :
I learnt the basics about **Trees** and most of the Geekforgeeks link above serves as notes but parts were missing there and hence I am writing them here so use this along with the [this link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-tree-data-structure/?ref=lbp) for complete notes on basics of Trees

-  _Level of Tree_ -> Root node is said to be at Depth 0 or Level 0 and the next layer of node is said to be at level 1 or depth 1 and so on


##### [Binary Trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-binary-tree/?ref=lbp):

##### Binary Tree Representation:
    - Using Linked List
        - Data
        - Left
        - Right
    - Python List (or Array)
        - 0th index is left blank
        - 1st index is root node
        - then index of left is given by 2x where x is the index of the node
        - then index of right is given by 2x + 1 where x is the index of the node

#### ðŸ“… Day 02 :
Implemetation for the Tree using LinkedList(Incomplete)

#### ðŸ“… Day 03 :
Revision and [Binary Search Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-binary-search-tree/?ref=lbp)
